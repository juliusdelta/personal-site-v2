### Uncanny Valley
###### Author: Anna Wiener

This book felt like a coming of age story of someone who's main lesson learned is that you can't find your life's meaning in work. The settings and circumstances surrounding that story are very eye opening. I realized how much of a
bubble Silicon Valley is and how arrogant "techies" can be when it comes to "solving the problems of the world." It's definitely worth a read.

### Can't Hurt Me

This book will stay one of my favorites for a long time. I definitely recommend listening to the AudioBook as it contains some extras in between each chapter and major sections of the book. 
I am definitely of the mind everyone should read it.
